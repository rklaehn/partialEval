package quickprofile

/**
 * Simple-to-use, fast, and relatively accurate benchmarking functions.
 *
 * `profile` runs an individual benchmark and reports performance.
 * `suite` runs a collection of benchmarks and reports relative performance.
 *
 * Unlike JMH, we do not require picking an arbitrary number of warmup iterations
 * or recorded iterations (often chosen to be either too small, yielding
 * inaccurate or wildly varying results, or too big, leading benchmarks to take
 * forever and not be run as part of normal development).
 *
 * See `profile` docs for more details on the methodology.
 *
 * Example usage: {{{
     import QuickProfile.{suite, profile}
     suite(
       profile("loop1") {
         val n = 1e6 + math.random
         while (n > 0.0) n -=1
         n.toLong
       },
       profile("loop2") {
         val n = 1e6 + math.random;
         (0 until 1000000).foreach { _ => n -= 1.0 }
         n.toLong
       },
       { // setup for the benchmark, won't be measured
         val nums = Vector.range(0, 1000000)
         // okay, start measuring
         profile("loop3") {
           val n = 1e6 + math.random;
           nums.foreach { _ => n -= 1.0 }
           n.toLong
         }
       }
     )
   }}}

 Which produces output like: {{{

   - loop1:  1.475 milliseconds (4.3% deviation, N=68, K = 0)
   - loop2:  1.069 milliseconds (4.3% deviation, N=224, K = 0)
   - loop3:  14.776 milliseconds (3.0% deviation, N=26, K = 0)
  1.0             loop2
  1.37            loop1
  13.81           loop3

object QuickProfile {

  /**
   * Run an action repeatedly, capturing profiling info, until the % deviation of
   * timing info is less than `threshold` (closer to 0). Idea is to discover the
   * steady state of performance that occurs when most hot spots have been JIT'd
   * without needing to pick an arbitrary number of warmup iterations and trials
   * (which are often either too small, leading to inaccurate results, or too big,
   * leading to profiling taking way too long).
   *
   * This function increases N--the number of times `action` is invoked per
   * iteration--until each iteration takes at least 100ms (so limited granularity
   * of System.nanoTime is no longer an issue). Once reaching this point,
   * it then gradually increase N exponentially (N = N * (1 + epsilon)) until percent
   * deviation drops below `threshold`. This all tends to happen pretty quickly.
   *
   * The `action` must return a `Long`, preferably unique for each execution, and the
   * sum of these numbers is threaded through the profiling computation to prevent the
   * JVM from doing any heroic optimizations that would eliminate executions of `action`.
   *
   * One caveat: JVM optimizations are not totally deterministic, so running the same
   * benchmark with a fresh JVM may reach a different steady state (though if performance
   * is highly sensitive to this, it could be a good idea to find a different way of
   * expressing your program such that performance is not as fragile). It's usually
   * obvious from a handful of runs of a benchmark whether any nondeterminism of JVM
   * optimizations is relevant for performance, but for maximum accuracy it can be a good
   * idea to average results from multiple JVM runs.
